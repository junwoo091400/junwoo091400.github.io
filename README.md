# CUSF Landing Predictor - Tawhiri / Leaflet Version

Cambridge University Spaceflight landing predictor - a web-based tool for predicting the flight path and landing location of latex meteorological sounding balloons. 

This fork of the [original predictor](https://github.com/jonsowman/cusf-standalone-predictor) contains a continuation of the original CUSF predictor, which utilises the [Tawhiri API](https://github.com/projecthorus/tawhiri/), and also uses Leaflet for mapping instead of Google Maps. 

A live version of the predictor intended for non-commercial use is available at http://predict.sondehub.org/ , hosted by the [Sondehub project](https://github.com/projecthorus/sondehub-infra/wiki).

If hosting this yourself, please note that it uses the Sondehub-hosted instance of Tawhiri. Please [contact us](https://github.com/projecthorus/sondehub-infra/wiki#contacts) to discuss fair usage of this API.
